# Data Structures for Competitive Programming

## Linear data structures

### Arrays

* Array
  * O(1) access
  * O(1) append
  * O(n) insertion
  * Fixed size
  * Very fast
* Bit array
  * An array for bits
* Bit field
  * Small bit array
  * Declared as int, etc.
* Bitboard
  * Store board as bits
  * Used in chess engines
* Circular buffer
  * Buffer where end goes to beginning
  * Used in data stream buffering
* Dynamic array
  * O(1) access
  * Amortized O(1) append
  * Backed by dynamically allocated array
  * Slower than array
* Gap buffer
  * 2 arrays
  * Fast insertion in between (O(1) at end of first array)
  * Used in text editors
* Hashed array tree
  * Array of memory fragments, which store data
  * Improved memory usage patterns
  * Less wasted space in between resizings than dynamic array
  * O(1) access, but slower
  * No hash function
* Lookup table
  * Store computations in a table
  * Only do a computation once
  * Used in population function (count bits in number)
* Matrix
  * 2d array
  * Fast math
* Parallel array
  * Store related information at same index of different arrays
* Sorted array
  * Stores elements in sorted order
  * O(log n) search
* Sparse array
  * Most elements are 0 (or some other value)
  * Implemented with a linked list
* Sparse matrix
  * Same, but in a matrix
* Iliffe vector
  * How Java does 2d arrays
  * Vector of pointers to arrays
  * Supports jagged arrays
* Variable-length array
  * Length determined at runtime
  * Supported in Java and C (GCC)
  * Slow in C
    * Automatically converted to allocation and freeing code

### Lists

* Linked list
  * Each node points to the next one
  * O(n) traversal
  * O(1) insertion at beginning or end
  * O(n) insertion elsewhere
  * 
* Doubly linked list
* Array list
* Self-organizing list
* Skip list
* Unrolled linked list
* VList
* Xor linked list
* Zipper
* Doubly connected edge list
* Difference list
* Free list
