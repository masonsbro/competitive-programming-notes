## Linear data structures

### Arrays

  * O(n) insertion
  * Fixed size
  * Very fast
* Bit array
  * An array for bits
* Bit field
  * Small bit array
  * Declared as int, etc.
* Bitboard
  * Store board as bits
  * Used in chess engines
* Circular buffer
  * Buffer where end goes to beginning
  * Used in data stream buffering
* Dynamic array
  * O(1) access
  * Amortized O(1) append
  * Backed by dynamically allocated array

* Gap buffer
  * 2 arrays
  * Fast insertion in between (O(1) at end of first array)
  * Used in text editors

  * Array of memory fragments, which store data
  * Improved memory usage patterns
  * Less wasted space in between resizings than dynamic array

  * Vector of pointers to arrays
  * Supports jagged arrays
* Variable-length array
  * Length determined at runtime
  * Supported in Java and C (GCC)
  * Slow in C
    * Automatically converted to allocation and freeing code

### Lists

* Linked list
  * Each node points to the next one
  * O(n) traversal
  * O(1) insertion at beginning or end
  * O(n) insertion elsewhere
* Doubly linked list
  * Nodes point backward and forward
* Array list
  * See dynamic array
* Self-organizing list
  * Automatically moves elements that will be accessed frequently toward the head
* Skip list
  * Multiple layers of linked lists
  * Faster traversal at the cost of more space
  * Can be used to implement binary search on a linked list
  * Usually determine which nodes are in higher layers probabilistically
* Unrolled linked list
  * Multple elements in each node, e.g. via array
  * Faster performance due to caching
* VList
  * O(1) access on average, O(log n) worst case
  * O(1) append to front
  * O(1) remove first element
  * O(log n) compute length
  * Immutable
  * Linked list of arrays with geometrically decreasing sizes
* Xor linked list
  * Doubly linked list with saved space
  * XOR next and prev together
  * When traversing, XOR nextprev with the last address
* Doubly connected edge list
  * Represents embedding of planar graph
  * Used in computational geometry
  * Used to represent Voronoi diagrams
* Difference list
  * Contains two lists and represents the difference between them
* Free list
  * Linked list of unallocated blocks
  * O(1) to allocate
  * O(1) to free
  * Poor locality of reference
  * Speed is lost when blocks differ in size

### Binary trees
