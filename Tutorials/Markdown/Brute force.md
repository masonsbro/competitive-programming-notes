### Discussion

A brute force problem is one in which the obvious algorithm is good enough; sometimes a more efficient solution is possible but more complex than the brute force approach. When reading a problem, it is often helpful to come up with a brute force approach even if the problem's contraints call for something faster. The brute force solution can serve as a starting point for the final solution. Of course, when the constraints are small enough that the brute force solution should run in time, no more thinking is necessary. Once you identify a problem as brute force, it becomes an implementation problem.

The primary hint that indicates that a problem should be solved with a brute force approach is the input size. Although it's kind of buried in the above problem, the input size for the hard part of the problem is very small.

### Further reading

The best way to get better at brute force problems is to practice. I recommend participating in all the Codeforces contests you can. The first two problems in these contests are often brute force or implementation problems. Most brute force problems are kind of ad-hoc--there's not a single approach that you can apply to all of them. I won't link any other resources to study, because there isn't really anything to study.
